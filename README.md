# CDDA-Mods
CDDA Mods that aren't mainlined.
Created during a time when RoaringJohn wasn't updating his repository. How updated this one is will be inversely proportional to how many weeks I've been away from home.

Please report issues with these mods. Suggestions for additions are welcome, except for mods which are being actively maintained elsewhere.


Notes about these mods-
Some of these may be wildly imbalanced, it's really on a case by case basis. I don't personally use all of these mods. I'll work through issues as time and motivation allows. My goal is to have every mod load without an error on loading. 



A bunch of mods have been removed from this repository because they are being updated elsewhere. Links to their proper repositories are below. If I can set up some sort of notification to update this repository when those updates occur, then maybe they shall be included again.

All credit for the original mods goes to their creators.

# Current update status
# Basically a dead repository#
I might be getting back into updating, but it has been so long I'm probably going to be making a new, much smaller one, since other people have taken up updating most of these in their own repositories. I hgihly reccomend TheGoatGod's repository linked below.

Check issues for the most important details. Testing in progress. Consider this repository WIP right now. As of 29 July 2020, it loads. Everything. Many errors are thrown, but it loads. I'll be working on cleaning it up over the coming days. 

ZSFixed_Extended Buildings and Roadwarrior (madmax) are borked and will not load. Hopefully fixed eventually

Touhou mod has had golems removed becasue they were broken. I'd like to fix and add them back in eventually.

Mightiest Heroes mod throws a version error for wolverine claws CBM. Since the item is unobtainable anyway it is low priority. The error is harmless.

Following my haitus, I used many of TheGoatGd's updates. The goat also has a *lot* more mods in the pack, but few I've wanted to add to this pack. It is however useful for things like Ascension. Definitely give it a look.


# Removed mods
(For reasons other than being mainlined or maintained elsewhere)
Disinfectant Powder, "powder_disinfectant", by Broken "Spaghetti" Admin- This mod doesn't add any way to create or obtain the disinfectant powder which it adds as an item, so it is effectively useless.
